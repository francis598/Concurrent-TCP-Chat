# Concurrent-TCP-Chat


A concurrent TCP chat system in Java, enabling real-time
messaging between multiple clients connected to a server. The server, built with
multi-threading, manages simultaneous client connections and broadcasts messages
to all users. Both client and server applications were packaged as executable JAR
files using Maven, resulting in a robust, multi-user chat system with smooth
communication and support for custom commands.
